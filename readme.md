# Photogallery
A photo album application based on Laravel.

## The point of this
* Help family members get off Facebook for sharing photos and videos.
* Requires invites and login to view photos.

## Setup
* Add the variable "GALLERYPATH" set to the full path of your photos/photo storage.
* artisan serve to view the files after it populates.

## Notes
* Personal project, but use what you like.
* Really just wanted to figure out how to resize images on the fly, and create an efficient way of displaying those images, and get people to stop making me look on Facebook.
